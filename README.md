# Taskï¼š
This project aims to enhance the effectiveness of the paid exposure promotion feature on its platform by tailoring different paid promotion requirements and effects for various target groups. This approach is intended to improve the utilization of promotional resources on the platform, foster better development of the platform's ecosystem, and predict the final outcomes of promotions by quantifying the effects of past paid promotions and platform-initiated promotions.

# Main Methods:
1) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.
2) Model Training and Optimization:
      Applying three key machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
3) Implementing Flask for web application development, setting up a platform to run the trained models.
